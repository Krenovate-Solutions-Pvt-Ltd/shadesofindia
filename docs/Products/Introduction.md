##  **Type of Products**

The WooCommerce platform offers many type of products that can be added to the website. Below, we will know the two types of products used at SOI:

*   **Simple Products** – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. A Simple product is the most common, basic, widely used and easily-understandable product type. It is a unique (there is only one version), stand-alone, physical product that you may have to ship to the customer. 

*   **Variable Products** – a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a t-shirt available in different colors and/or sizes.

Variable products are a product type that lets you offer a set of variations on a product, with control over prices, stock, image and more for each variation. They can be used for a product like a shirt, where you can offer a large, medium and small and in different colors.
