#   **Products**

## **Introduction**

Products on any eCommerce website, are items which are available to a customer for buying. At SOI, different products available are:

-   Women's Clothing
-   Accessories
-   Home & Living

##  **Type of Products**

The WooCommerce platform offers many type of products that can be added to the website. Below is a list of available product types:

*   **Simple** – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options. For example, a book.
*   **Grouped** – a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products. For example, a set of six drinking glasses.
*   **Virtual** – one that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields such as shipping dimensions. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart and checkout.
*   **Downloadable** – activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file. After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order notification email. This is suitable, for example, for a digital album, PDF magazine, or photo.
*   **External or Affiliate** – one that you list and describe on your website but is sold elsewhere.
*   **Variable** – a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a t-shirt available in different colors and/or sizes.
