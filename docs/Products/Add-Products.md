By following the above steps correctly, the product page is almost ready. Some more tweaks and finishing touches to the right side panel will make the product page more user-friendly. Let's look at the menu options to be updated here:

####    **Product Categories**

Product categories help in organizing the products. Categories are the primary way to group products with similar features. You can also add sub-categories if desired. We refer to them as levels.

-   **L1 - Parent Category**
-   **L2 - Sub-category**
-   **L3 - Sub-sub-category**

![category levels](Images\categorylevels.jpg)

Category levels can also be **reordered** by dragging and dropping – this order is used by default on the front-end whenever the categories are listed. This includes both widgets and the category/subcategory views on product pages.

The customers will be able to use the categories on the front-end of the website store in the form of filters to find/shortlist products.

![prodcat](Images\prodcat.jpg)


1.  Go to -> **Product Categories**
2.  Choose from existing categories, sub-categories and sub-sub-categories.


This is how the category filter looks on the website:

![cat filter](Images\catfilter.jpg)

####    **Product Tags**

Product tags are another way to relate products to each other, next to product categories. Contrary to categories, there is no hierarchy in tags; so there are no “subtags.”

The customers will be able to use the tags on the front-end of the website store in the form of filters to find products. Try to make them logical and useful for your target customers.

![prodtags](Images\Simple-Products\prodtags.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Product Tags**
2.  **Add** keywords seperated with commas
3.  You can also **choose from the most used tags**



####    **Colors**

Colors help in organizing, searching the products on the basis of color category/family. 

The customers will be able to use this as a color filter on the front-end of the website store to find products.

![colors](Images\colors.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Colors**
2.  Select from the existing list

The color filter on the website:

![color filter](Images\Simple-Products\colorfilter.jpg)

####    **Materials**

![materials](Images\materials.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Materials**
2.  Select from the existing list

The material filter looks as below:

![material filter](Images\Simple-Products\materialfilter.jpg)

####    **Product Image**

    ![setprodimage](Images\Simple-Products\setprodimage.jpg)

    ![prodimage](Images\Simple-Products\prodimage.jpg)

A snapshot of the product image in the catalog on the website is below:

![prod image1](Images\prodimagefinal.jpg)

####    **Product Gallery**

Product galleries display all images attached to a product through the Product Gallery meta box. You can add extra images that appear in the gallery on the single product page.

Follow the below steps to add gallery images:

![prod gallery](Images\Simple-Products\prodgallery.jpg) 

1.  Go to -> **Product Gallery**
2.  Click -> **Add product gallery image**
3.  Select existing images or upload new ones.

>   **Images in the product gallery can be re-ordered easily via drag and drop.**

>   **To remove an image from the product gallery, hover over the image and click on the red “x.”** 

This is how the product gallery appears on the website product page:

![prodgalleryfinal](Images\Simple-Products\prodgallery1.jpg)


>   **Note** - The first image in the Product Gallery is the same as the Product Image. Rest of the images are known as Gallery Images.

####    **Setting catalog visibility options and feature status**

In the Publish panel, you can set Catalog Visibility for your product. The below options are available to choose from:

![catalogvisibility](Images\Simple-Products\catalogvisibility.jpg)

-   **Search only** – Visible in search results, but not in the shop page or category pages.
