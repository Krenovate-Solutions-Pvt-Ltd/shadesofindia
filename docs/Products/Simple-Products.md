### **Right Side Panel - Add some finishing touches**

By following the above steps correctly, the product page is almost ready. Some more tweaks and finishing touches to the right side panel will make the product page more user-friendly. Let's look at the menu options to be updated here:

####    **Product Categories**

Product categories help in organizing the products. Categories are the primary way to group products with similar features. You can also add sub-categories if desired.

Categories can also be **reordered** by dragging and dropping – this order is used by default on the front end whenever the categories are listed. This includes both widgets and the category/subcategory views on product pages.

:computer: [How to add categories and sub-categories](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#section-1)

The customers will be able to use the categories on the front-end of the website store in the form of filters to find products.

![prodcat](Images\Simple-Products\prodcat.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Product Categories**
2.  Choose from existing categories and sub-categories.
3.  Click -> **Add New Category** to add new names.


####    **Product Tags**

Product tags are another way to relate products to each other, next to product categories. Contrary to categories, there is no hierarchy in tags; so there are no “subtags.”

The customers will be able to use the tags on the front-end of the website store in the form of filters to find products. Try to make them logical and useful for your target customers.

![prodtags](Images\Simple-Products\prodtags.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Product Tags**
2.  **Add** keywords seperated with commas
3.  You can also **choose from the most used tags**



####    **Colors**

Colors help in organizing the products on the basis of color category/family. The customers will be able to use this as a color filter on the front-end of the website store to find products.

![colors](Images\Simple-Products\colors.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Colors**
2.  Select from the existing list
3.  Click -> **Add New Color** to add more choices

####    **Materials**

Materials help in organizing the products on the basis of material used (fabric, accessories). The customers will be able to use this as a material filter on the front-end of the website store to find products.

![materials](Images\Simple-Products\materials.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Materials**
2.  Select from the existing list
3.  Click -> **Add New Material** to add more choices

The menu options - product categories, colors, material show on the website as filters to choose from. A snapshot for the same is below:

####    **Product Image**

The Product Image is the main image for your product and is reused in different sizes across your store. This will be the largest image on the single product page and will also appear on the catalog page.

Follow the steps to add image:


1.  Go to -> **Product Image** 
2.  Click -> **Set Product Image**

####    **Product Gallery**

Product galleries display all images attached to a product through the Product Gallery meta box. You can add extra images that appear in the gallery on the single product page.

Follow the below steps to add gallery images:

![prod gallery](Images\Simple-Products\prodgallery.jpg)

1.  Go to -> **Product Gallery**
2.  Click -> **Add product gallery image**
3.  Select existing images or upload new ones.
