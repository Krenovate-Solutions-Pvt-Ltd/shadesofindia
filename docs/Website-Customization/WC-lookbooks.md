#   **WC Lookbooks**

##  **Introduction**

A lookbook is a collection of images compiled to show different styles, combinations etc. of a particular theme. This gives visitors ideas on how to style outfits or their homes.

On the SOI website, we create lookbook ids for the Home & Living section. The generated id is inserted in the section images field of the Home & Living section on the Homepage.
