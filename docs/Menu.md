#   **Menu**

##  **Introduction**

Menus are a list of links that are usually displayed as the main navigation for a website. A menu allows to do the following things:

-   Create sub-menus 
-   Change order of pages in the menu
-   Create links to category pages which can directly take the customer to respective product pages.

Menu placement can be decided as per requirement. In case of SOI, the menu is displayed horizontly at the top of the website.

In this section of the manual, we will see how multiple options can be added to the menu along with deciding the position/order of the same.

##  **Product Categories**

Product categories help in organizing the products. Categories are the primary way to group products with similar features. You can also add sub-categories if desired. We refer to them as levels.

* L1 - Parent Category
* L2 - Sub-category
* L3 - Sub-sub-category
