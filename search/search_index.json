Users with the administrator role/rights can: add new posts edit any posts delete any posts install, edit, delete plugins and themes add new users edit user information delete any user This role is basically reserved for site owners and gives them full control of the whole website. Add a New Admin User \u00b6 In this section, we will look at the steps to be followed to add a New user with Admin rights. Go to ShadesofIndia Login with the credentials, you will reach the admin dashboard Click -> Users Click -> Add New Fill the below form: User Name - It is a required field. Add any name you wish. The filed is case sensitive so it is advised not to use capital letters. Email - This is a required field. Enter the email id. The entered email id cannot be used for any other role. First Name - Enter the user's first name Last Name - Enter the user's last name Website - This field is NA.

Send User Notification - Always enable this option -> this will send an email notification to the user Role - From the drop down select the role as Administrator Click -> Add New User at the bottom of the form. User Verification \u00b6 Once the user is created, an email notification is received on the registered email id. This email helps in making the created account active. Follow the below steps: Click -> Link in the email Copy the password shown and save Click -> Reset the password Once password is rest, login with the Username and password. Note - Never save passwords on the working machine. Two Factor Authentication (2FA) \u00b6 Two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as two-step verification or dual-factor authentication , is a security process in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. Two-factor authentication methods rely on a user providing a password, as well as a second factor, usually either a security token or a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint or facial scan. Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process by making it harder for attackers to gain access to a person's devices or online accounts. Download AUTHY \u00b6 Authy is the authenticator app that we use to enable the 2FA. Below are the steps to download the app: Go to -> Authy Website On top right side corner, Click -> Download Go to -> Desktop Select your operating system - mac/windows Run Setup to install Authy on your machine. Authy Account Setup \u00b6 Run Setup to install Authy on your machine. Select Country -> India (+91) Enter -> Mobile number, Click Next Enter -> email id for notifications Select -> SMS - to receive verification code Enter -> Code received on mobile number Now your Authy setup is complete. Connect Authy to Admin Account \u00b6 Click -> \"+\" sign Generate code in the website admin panel. Steps to get code are below: Go to -> Admin Panel Go to -> Wordfence -> Login Security Copy code visible under the Bar code Paste the code in Authy Click -> Add account Add -> Account Name Scroll to the bottom of given list. Select -> Wordpress Choose -> Token Length - Recommended length is 6 digit Click -> Save Copy the visible code. This code changes every 30 seconds. Go back to -> Admin Panel Paste code under section 2 Click -> Activate Recovery Codes \u00b6 Once the connection between Authy and Admin account is set up, a pop-up comes up - Download Recovery Codes Click -> Download : The text file has 5 extra codes in case the previous code is lost. Save for future use. The recovery codes, can be used if you ever lose your authenticator device or if you remove the app or its saved codes by mistake. Make sure you store these codes in a safe place. Because they don\u2019t expire, recovery codes are longer than normal codes \u2014 16 letters and numbers instead of only 6 numbers \u2014 but each code can only be used once. You can generate new recovery codes on the Login Security page of your site. Generating new codes will invalidate the previous codes. Login with 2 Factor Authentication \u00b6 Go to ShadesofIndia Enter Username and Password Click -> Log In When the 2FA Code prompt appears -> enter the code from the authy app; this code gets updated every 30 seconds Again Click -> Log In Important - Enable 2FA based on Roles \u00b6 Once, all the above steps have been followed and the 2FA has been setup, the most important/mandatory step to be followed is to Enable 2FA for the respective roles .
